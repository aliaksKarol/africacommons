    Drum Magazine was once the most widely read magazine in Africa. Its
    journalists influenced political outcomes and are credited with changing the
    way Black South African, Indian, and Multiracial communities were
    represented in society. Drum became an important platform for a new
    generation of writers and photographers and it served as an important
    vehicle for voicing resistance - from the Defiance Campaign of 1952 to the
    Sharpeville Massacre in 1960. The magazine covered a wide range of topics,
    including politics, culture, sports, and entertainment.
